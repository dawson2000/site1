SUMMARY
========

This sidebox presents a mini poll to the customer, one question, up to six options, single or multiple choice. 
If defined, the customer can also enter his own option text as his vote. 
After submitting the vote, the customer will see the poll results so far in the sidebox.
The customer can also click a link in the sidebox to display the results of all polls so far (if enabled
by the shop owner).
From the administrative interface, the shop owner can define and maintain multiple polls, and view the vote results.


LIMITATIONS
===========

- There are no limitations to the number of polls that can be defined and/or active simultaneously.
- Each poll can only have six options.
- Each poll can only have one text input field for a custom vote input.
- This package has been tested on Windows Server2003 with IIS6.0 and PHP 5.2/5.3, 
  with Zen-Cart version 1.3.9h and version 1.5.0beta


IMPACT ON EXISTING INSTALLATION
===============================

Poll Manager uses it's own database tables, which are created with the install.sql script. 
A second script is provided to remove these tables again.
No existing scripts are changed, but please check if any existing buttons might be overwritten with the ones in the package.


POLL DESCRIPTION
================

A poll has the following attributes:
- Poll description      : The title of the poll. This is only visible to the admin.
- Poll question         : The question that will appear to the customer, in the poll sidebox.
- Poll type             : Single choice (customer can select only one option) or multiple choice (customer can select
                          more than one option).
- Poll multivote        : The customer can vote for the same poll multiple times or only once
- Poll primary	        : One poll can be primary and will be presented first to new visitors
- Poll status           : Active (poll will be presented to the customers) or Inactive (poll will only appear in the
                          administrative interface).
- Poll on overview page : If the results for this poll should be shown on the overview page
- Poll options          : The options the customer can vote on. Each poll has at least two options defined.

A poll option has the following attributes:
- Option number         : This is automatically assigned by PM.
- Text input            : If selected, the customer will see a text input field below the option choice text. 
                          Only one option can have such an input field.
- Option text           : The text that will be presented to the customer for this option.
- Option votes          : The number of times this option was voted on.
- Customer texts        : The texts that customers have entered (only if text input was selected for the option).


FUNCTIONS
=========

Basically, Poll Manager has three main functions:

1. A Poll sidebox, which can be added to your shop with the normal administrative functions (Tools -> Layout Boxes Controller)
The customer will be presented a randomly chosen active poll. However, PM will avoid to display the same poll twice 
subsequently, that is if more than one active poll can be presented to the customer.
After choosing one (or more, depending on the poll type) option,
the customer clicks the Vote button. The poll sidebox will then refresh and show the poll results so far.
A user (actually an IP address) will not be presented a poll again, on which he already voted, unless the multivote option
for this poll is activated by the shop owner.
Various checks are done before the vote is actually submitted. The vote button will only become active if (at least) one 
option is selected. A selected but empty input text fields will be deselected before submit.

2. A poll overview page, on which the customer can select a poll from a dropdown menu, to see the results recorded so far.
Only polls for which the administrator has indicated that the results can be shown here, will appear.
The dropdown list is not displayed if only one poll is available for display.
The link to the overview page is in the poll box, and the current poll is displayed by default.
Through the 'Edit Page' option in the administrative interface of Zen-Cart, the administrator can add text, pictures or
whatever to the bottom of the page. Also the layout can be tailored with specific CSS-classes (see below).

3. An administrative interface to define, alter and delete the polls, and view the poll results.
Some remarks on the various admin functions:

For testing purposes, the votes done from the current admin's IP can be deleted from a poll.
A button will show up if this is applicable.

All votes from a specific poll can be removed. A button will show up if this is applicable.

Be careful with making changes to an existing poll. If the content of the options is changed, the votes for the old content 
still exist and will make the poll results unreliable. Nevertheless PM will allow editing existing polls, to give the 
ability to remove typo's etc.

If an option is defined as Text input, the entered texts can be made visible by clicking the respective option text, which 
appears as a link.
If no input is given yet, the option text is just text, no link.


LAYOUT ISSUES
=============

Many shop-templates use their own stylesheet, with styles defined different from standard Zen-Cart.
Because of this, texts in the poll sidebox may not be displayed in the correct layout.
In the file includes/templates/<YOUR TEMPLATE>/css/style_pollmanager.css, all styles that are used in the poll sidebox 
(poll options and poll results) can be modidfied as needed. The layout is completely stylesheet-driven.

For the overview page, the following styles are defined in the page code, and can be used in your stylesheet
to change the appearance of the page:

#Poll_overview for the entire page
#Poll_overviewHeading for the page title 
.pollResults for each entire block of question and options/results
.pollResultsOption for each option/result 


INSTALLATION
============

1. Unzip the package anywhere.
2. Zen-Cart 1.5 ONLY: Remove the folder admin/includes/boxes/extra_boxes
3. Change the folder name 'admin' to the appropriate one for your website.
4. Change the folder name 'YOUR TEMPLATE' to the folder name of the template you have in use.
5. From the admin interface, Tools -> Install SQL Patches, run the file install_zc_1.3.sql or install_zc_1.5.sql,
   depending on the version of Zencart that you have in use.
   Either copy the content in the window, or upload the file.
6. Check if any buttons with the same name already exists in the same folder of your installation.
   Just by deleting them from the files in the package, you will keep the old buttons.
7. Copy all files to the root of your installation, 
   EXCEPT: install_zc_1.3.sql
           install_zc_1.5.sql
           uninstall_zc_1.3.sql
           uninstall_zc_1.5.sql
           upgrade1.0_to_1.1.sql
           poll_manager.txt
           license.txt
8. That's it. Now you can define your first poll! And don't forget to activate the sidebox!


UPGRADING FROM EARLIER VERSIONS
===============================

1. Follow the installation steps above, EXCEPT for step 5.
2. If you upgrade from PM 1.0, manually remove the file includes/modules/sideboxes/poll_box.php
3. If you upgrade from PM 1.0, run the upgrade1.0_to_1.1.sql patch file from your admin 
   interface (Tools->Install SQL Patches)
   
There is no upgrade script (needed) for the upgrade from PM 1.1 to 1.2.


REMOVING POLL MANAGER
=====================

You can remove Poll Manager with the following steps:
1. Remove the sidebox from the page definition (Tools -> Layout Boxes Controller)
2. Run the uninstall script, provided with the package (Tools -> Install SQL Patches)
3. Delete the files that are mentioned below
4. In the admin interface, go to: Tools -> Layout Boxes Controller. The poll box may still be present
   there, with a warning that it's missing. Also you will get the option to remove the poll box. After 
   selecting this, the poll box will be removed from the list.
